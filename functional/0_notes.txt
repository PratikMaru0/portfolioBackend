1. Difference between mongo schema and model 

ðŸ”¹ Schema
    * Defines the structure of a MongoDB document.
    * Specifies field names, data types, defaults, and validations.
    * Acts as a blueprint â€” doesnâ€™t interact with the database directly.
    * Created using `mongoose.Schema()`.


ðŸ”¸ Model
    * Compiled version of a schema.
    * Represents a MongoDB collection.
    * Used to perform database operations (create, read, update, delete).
    * Created using `mongoose.model()` with a schema.


 ðŸŽ¯ Quick analogy:
    * Schema = Blueprint
    * Model = Functional object based on the blueprint
